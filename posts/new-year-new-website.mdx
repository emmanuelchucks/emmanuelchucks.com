# {frontmatter.title}

Don't let the simplicity and minimalism fool you, this build is chock-full of
OCD-fueled attention to detail.

Semantic markup, check. Progressively-enhanced search forms, check.
High-fidelity dark mode, check. Seamless keyboard-navigation, check. Easter
eggs no one will probably ever notice, check.

Go ahead, call my bluff and test it out for yourself.

## {semanticSections}

Say it with me, any `section` tag without a heading is an over-glorified `div`.

<Wrong heading={semanticSections}>
	```html
	<section>
		<p>Pandas have an extra bone just for eating.</p>
		<p>Sloth bears use their lips like a vacuum.</p>
		<p>Brown bears are the most widespread.</p>
	</section>
	```
</Wrong>

<Correct heading={semanticSections}>
	```html
	<section aria-labelledby="heading-420">
		<h2 id="heading-420">Useless bear facts</h2>
		<p>Pandas have an extra bone just for eating.</p>
		<p>Sloth bears use their lips like a vacuum.</p>
		<p>Brown bears are the most widespread.</p>
	</section>
	```
</Correct>

## {stylingWebkitElements}

Styling the built-in cancel button in search inputs to match your brand colors
will likely land you on the naughty list, but it's to die for.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```css
[type="search"]::-webkit-search-cancel-button {
	filter: 
		brightness(0) saturate(100%)
		invert(26%) sepia(0%)
		saturate(1051%) hue-rotate(135deg)
		brightness(85%) contrast(89%);
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	[type="search"]::-webkit-search-cancel-button {
		filter: 
			brightness(0) saturate(100%)
			invert(94%) sepia(15%)
			saturate(0%) hue-rotate(176deg)
			brightness(89%) contrast(92%);
	}
}
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<DemoBox heading={stylingWebkitElements}>
	<StyledSearchInput />
</DemoBox>

## {darkModeScrollbars}

Never leave your scrollbars out of the fun. Scrollbars need love too. Remember
to target the root element not just `body`.

```css
:root {
	color-scheme: light dark;
}
```

<DemoBox heading={darkModeScrollbars}>
	<DarkModeSwitcher>
		<p>
			Using JavaScript, it is possible to dynamically change parts of a
			page without requiring the entire page to reload — for instance, to
			update a list of search results on the fly, or to display a discreet
			alert or notification which does not require user interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			While these changes are usually visually apparent to users who can
			see the page, they may not be obvious to users of assistive
			technologies. ARIA live regions fill this gap and provide a way to
			programmatically expose dynamic content changes in a way that can be
			announced by assistive technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dynamic content which updates without a page reload is generally
			either a region or a widget. Simple content changes which are not
			interactive should be marked as live regions. A live region is
			explicitly denoted using the aria-live attribute.
		</p>
		<p>
			aria-live: The aria-live=POLITENESS_SETTING is used to set the
			priority with which screen reader should treat updates to live
			regions - the possible settings are: off, polite or assertive. The
			default setting is off. This attribute is by far the most important.
		</p>
	</DarkModeSwitcher>
</DemoBox>

## Closing notes

I look forward to writing regularly on everything tech and design related. This
blog will become a testing ground for everything I learn on my engineering
journey. See you soon.
