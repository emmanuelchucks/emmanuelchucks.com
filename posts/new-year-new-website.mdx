# {frontmatter.title}

Don't let the simplicity and minimalism fool you, this build is chock-full of
OCD-fueled attention to detail.

Semantic markup, check. Progressively-enhanced search forms, check.
High-fidelity dark mode, check. Seamless keyboard-navigation, check. Easter
eggs no one will probably ever notice, check.

Go ahead, call my bluff and test it out for yourself.

## {semanticSections}

Say it with me, any `section` tag without a heading is an over-glorified `div`.

<Wrong heading={semanticSections}>
	```html
	<section>
		<p>Pandas have an extra bone just for eating.</p>
		<p>Sloth bears use their lips like a vacuum.</p>
		<p>Brown bears are the most widespread.</p>
	</section>
	```
</Wrong>

<Correct heading={semanticSections}>
	```html
	<section>
		<h2>Useless bear facts</h2>
		<p>Pandas have an extra bone just for eating.</p>
		<p>Sloth bears use their lips like a vacuum.</p>
		<p>Brown bears are the most widespread.</p>
	</section>
	```
</Correct>

## {stylingWebkitElements}

Styling the built-in cancel button in search inputs to match your brand colors
will likely land you on the naughty list, but it's to die for.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```css
[type="search"]::-webkit-search-cancel-button {
	filter: 
		brightness(0) saturate(100%)
		invert(26%) sepia(0%)
		saturate(1051%) hue-rotate(135deg)
		brightness(85%) contrast(89%);
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	[type="search"]::-webkit-search-cancel-button {
		filter: 
			brightness(0) saturate(100%)
			invert(94%) sepia(15%)
			saturate(0%) hue-rotate(176deg)
			brightness(89%) contrast(92%);
	}
}
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<DemoBox heading={stylingWebkitElements}>
	<StyledSearchInput />
</DemoBox>

## {darkModeScrollbars}

Never leave your scrollbars out of the fun. Scrollbars need love too. Remember
to target the root element not just `body`.

```css
:root {
	color-scheme: light dark;
}
```

<DemoBox heading={darkModeScrollbars}>
	<DarkModeScrollbars />
</DemoBox>

## Closing notes

I look forward to writing regularly on everything tech and design related. This
blog will become a testing ground for everything I learn on my engineering
journey. See you soon.
