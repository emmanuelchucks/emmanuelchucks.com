# {frontmatter.title}

Don't let the simplicity and minimalism fool you, this build is chock-full of
OCD-fueled attention to detail.

Semantic markup, check. Progressively-enhanced search forms, check.
High-fidelity dark mode, check. Seamless keyboard-navigation, check. Easter
eggs no one will probably ever notice, check.

Go ahead, call my bluff and test it out for yourself.

export const semanticSections = "Semantic sections"

## {semanticSections}

Say it with me, any `section` tag without a heading is a glorified `div`.

import { Wrong, Correct } from "~/components/wrong-correct.tsx"

<Wrong heading={semanticSections}>
	```html
	<section>
		<p>Pandas have an extra bone just for eating.</p>
		<p>Sloth bears use their lips like a vacuum.</p>
		<p>Brown bears are the most widespread.</p>
	</section>
	```
</Wrong>

<Correct heading={semanticSections}>
	```html
	<section aria-labelledby="heading">
		<h2 id="heading">Useless bear facts</h2>
		<p>Pandas have an extra bone just for eating.</p>
		<p>Sloth bears use their lips like a vacuum.</p>
		<p>Brown bears are the most widespread.</p>
	</section>
	```
</Correct>

export const stylingWebkitElements = "Styling webkit elements"

## {stylingWebkitElements}

Styling the built-in cancel button in search inputs to match your brand colors
will likely land you on the naughty list, but it's to die for.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```css
[type="search"]::-webkit-search-cancel-button {
	filter: 
		brightness(0) saturate(100%)
		invert(26%) sepia(0%)
		saturate(1051%) hue-rotate(135deg)
		brightness(85%) contrast(89%);
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	[type="search"]::-webkit-search-cancel-button {
		filter: 
			brightness(0) saturate(100%)
			invert(94%) sepia(15%)
			saturate(0%) hue-rotate(176deg)
			brightness(89%) contrast(92%);
	}
}
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

import { Demo } from "~/components/demo.tsx"
import { StyledSearchInput } from "./demo-styled-search-input.tsx"

<Demo heading={stylingWebkitElements}>
	<StyledSearchInput />
</Demo>

export const darkModeScrollbars = "Dark-mode scrollbars"

## {darkModeScrollbars}

Never leave your scrollbars out of the fun. Scrollbars need love too. Remember
to target the root element not just `body`.

```css
:root {
	color-scheme: light dark;
}
```

<Demo heading={darkModeScrollbars}>
	<p>
		Using JavaScript, it is possible to dynamically change parts of a page
		without requiring the entire page to reload — for instance, to update a list
		of search results on the fly, or to display a discreet alert or notification
		which does not require user interaction.
	</p>
	<p>
		While these changes are usually visually apparent to users who can see the
		page, they may not be obvious to users of assistive technologies. ARIA live
		regions fill this gap and provide a way to programmatically expose dynamic
		content changes in a way that can be announced by assistive technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dynamic content which updates without a page reload is generally either a
		region or a widget. Simple content changes which are not interactive should
		be marked as live regions. A live region is explicitly denoted using the
		aria-live attribute.
	</p>
	<p>
		aria-live: The aria-live=POLITENESS_SETTING is used to set the priority with
		which screen reader should treat updates to live regions - the possible
		settings are: off, polite or assertive. The default setting is off. This
		attribute is by far the most important.
	</p>
	<p>
		Normally, only aria-live="polite" is used. Any region which receives updates
		that are important for the user to receive, but not so rapid as to be
		annoying, should receive this attribute. The screen reader will speak
		changes whenever the user is idle.
	</p>
	<p>
		aria-live="assertive" should only be used for time-sensitive/critical
		notifications that absolutely require the user's immediate attention.
		Generally, a change to an assertive live region will interrupt any
		announcement a screen reader is currently making. As such, it can be
		extremely annoying and disruptive and should only be used sparingly.
	</p>
	<p>
		As aria-live="off" is the assumed default for elements, it should not be
		necessary to set this explicitly, unless you're trying to suppress the
		announcement of elements which have an implicit live region role (such as
		role="alert").
	</p>
</Demo>

## Closing notes

I look forward to writing regularly on everything tech and design related. This
blog will become a testing ground for everything I learn on my engineering
journey. See you soon.
